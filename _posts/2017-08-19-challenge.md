The biggest challenge I have faced when learning to develop is time management. I am an incredibly curious person and even though that almost always leads to a good outcome, it is not particularly productive when you are trying to build something.

I have to set some rules for myself in order to keep focused. I will work on a task for an hour, if after an hour I haven't made any progress, I have to remind myself to ask for help. Reach out to my mentor, my slack channel or simply call a friend for a fresh set of eyes.

In this day and age, it is easy to get distracted and suddenly lose 3 hours staring at my phone. I have mitigated this with some basic conditioning. I put on my headphones and loop some rain sounds. The rule is, while there is rain playing I am focused and totally immersed in my code. There are no distractions and nothing else requires my attention.

After a while of doing this, the mind is able to slip into that focused state simply by listening to a trigger, in this case, rain. This may be written off as overly simplistic but it is really powerful. Build a habit and attach it to some cue to make it a trigger.
