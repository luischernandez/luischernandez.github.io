Quick intro about me:<br>
I gotta find something compelling to say here. Maybe later, for now, it will suffice to say that I believe in
producing, not just consuming. Since I was a kid, I have known that I am an engineer at heart and later went on to actually became one in order to build things and help people improve their lives through technology (romantic, yes, I know).

Making things and putting them out into the physical world takes resources, (tools, space, materials, etc..).
So naturally it was only a matter of time before I started to look at digital things to make, being that all you really need is a computer and brain power... lots of it, brain power I mean. In order words, get a computer, learn to code, get to building.

Alright, so, I got the computer, I have learned to code, let's get building.
