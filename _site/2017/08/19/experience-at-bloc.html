  <section class="post-content"><p>Quick context and overview:</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and over 5 years experience in the aerospace industry.
Why do I mention this? Because I believe where you come from and what previous experiences you’ve had, affect how you view the world and how you interact with it. So for me, I come from a technical background but one where there is not a lot of creativity. Most people don’t know this but, for the most part, airplanes and helicopters are old technology (think 1950’s). Creativity and innovation are not the drivers in this industry. The real drivers are reliability and safety, and what can be more reliable than a design that has been shown to have flown around for more than 50 years with 0 casualties? What this means is that manufacturing processes may change and evolve but the designs are pretty much the same from 60 years ago. I can make a whole post dedicated to things that hold back the aerospace industry but that is a different story for a different time.</p>

<p>Moving on, as an Engineer, I have learned to make systems on which I rely to do my job. Most importantly the whole act of engineering is based on breaking down a task into smaller, more digestible steps. And naturally this approach is something I apply to my experience at BLOC.</p>

<p>So, how has my experience at BLOC been? Overall, really good. Now, mind you, at the time of this post, I am only 12% into the program, so things can still sway one way or the other. But, let’s break it down a little more.</p>

<p>I am on the Software Developer track at a pace of 54 weeks (just over a year). If you wish to learn more about their other courses click <a href="https://www.bloc.io">here.</a></p>

<p>The software developer track (SDT) at BLOC, at a pace of 54 weeks, suggests that at least 20 hours of work a week are required. I have found that is the bare minimum. I have had weeks where I spent over 40 hours working through it.</p>

<p>As I have made progress through the program I have had to readjust my strategy to be a successful student. I have spoken to my family about my time commitment and how it is going to take time away from other activities and made sure they are ok with that.</p>

<p>Initially, I quantified my available hours in a day and simply compared it to the amount of hours required by the SDT. Not the best approach. You see, I typically get home from work at 5:30 PM, so I simply thought, <em>‘well, I will work on BLOC from 6 PM to 10 PM on weekdays (4 hours per day) and 5 hours on saturday and 5 hours on sunday, for a total of 30 hours a week, that should do it.’</em>  Well, in reality, after waking up at 4:45 and commuting for 45 mins and putting in an average of 10 hours of engineering work a day at my job, the quality of work that I am able to put into the program is not the best; I feel tired, hungry and the whole experience becomes a little more frustrating. Furthermore, any sort of hurdle that keeps me up past 11 PM (which are not uncommon) directly affects my sleep. While this may not seem like much, when you are facing 54 weeks of it, the strategy needs to be adjusted.</p>

<p>So what do I do now? I get home, say hi to the family, have a quick bite, set my alarm and take an hour long nap. No checking Facebook, turning on the TV or any other distraction. I typically work on the program from 8 PM to 11:30 PM now. I have found that if I take a nap, even if I am only able to put in 2 hours of work a day, the quality of my work  is a lot better and I am able to troubleshoot a little better faster.</p>

<p>The most useful thing I have learned from the people at bloc is that you don’t need to know everything, in fact, don’t even try, because you never will, the information is too vast. Rather, the goal should be to <em>“know enough that you can keep moving forward.”</em> Know where things are for future reference but don’t waste time studying and researching details that are not beneficial to the task at hand.</p>

<!-- Jeykll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Here's an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Pygments by default.

Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$ -->
