        <title>Journey into Tech</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It didn’t make sense, I was a mechanical engineer, working in aerospace. We were building aircrafts, helicopters,
planes, components that went into rockets, satellites and fighter jets! And yet, it felt dull. Everybody I told about my job thought it was so impressive and well, cool. Everybody except me, but I could not explain why it felt that way. Hadn’t I gone through all this effort to become an engineer to build things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without really having a plan I decided to explore different interests, maybe find some new hobbies that would fill this need I felt I had. So, I decided to hit some meet-ups. Business, finance, virtual reality, computer aided design, 3d printing, etc. Then one day I came across a meet-up dedicated to becoming a developer, and things quickly clicked that very night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the course of a few hours, I learned about the people and the mindset in the industry. Things like open source software, the fact that everybody shares their work and are willing to help you out, the incredible creativity that spawns over geeky subjects like video games or sci-fi movies. I learned that there is an increasing need for developers and that the jobs pay well. But what did it for me was the fact that all that is really needed is a solid skillset and the possibilities could be endless. It was truly empowering, at least it felt it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the drive home, I thought about how much this industry made sense and so I made the decision to become part of this world I had just stumbled upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few weeks were interesting. I had learned about boot camps and courses and resources and a bunch of different ways to acquire skills. &lt;em&gt;‘As I have a full time job, wife and two daughters to support, I could not just quit my job and bet it all on some 13 week bootcamp, or could I…? Maybe if I pulled some savings and maybe lean on the credit cards a little bit, no no no, too risky. On the other hand, after 13 weeks, my professional life could be turned around, yes, it could be. But what guarantees do I have? None, nothing is ever certain.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my pragmatic mind prevailed and I decided slow and steady would be a better choice. I would not quit my job and I would find a system that would allow for some flexibility but at the same time demand accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on this shopping/research spree for boot camps and discovered an overwhelming range of them. Bootcamps vary in length, content, structure, financing, pricing model, online, own paced. Wow!! How to pick one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went through some on-site tours of a couple of boot camps, asked a lot of people, kept going to meet ups and meeting new people, asked a bunch of representatives about their advantages and structure. Yes, it took a while but finally I came across BLOC and the rest of the alternatives kinda faded. &lt;em&gt;‘I think I found it.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My experience at BLOC</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/08/19/experience-at-bloc.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2017/08/19/experience-at-bloc.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick context and overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and over 5 years experience in the aerospace industry.
Why do I mention this? Because I believe where you come from and what previous experiences you’ve had, affect how you view the world and how you interact with it. So for me, I come from a technical background but one where there is not a lot of creativity. Most people don’t know this but, for the most part, airplanes and helicopters are old technology (think 1950’s). Creativity and innovation are not the drivers in this industry. The real drivers are reliability and safety, and what can be more reliable than a design that has been shown to have flown around for more than 50 years with 0 casualties? What this means is that manufacturing processes may change and evolve but the designs are pretty much the same from 60 years ago. I can make a whole post dedicated to things that hold back the aerospace industry but that is a different story for a different time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, as an Engineer, I have learned to make systems on which I rely to do my job. Most importantly the whole act of engineering is based on breaking down a task into smaller, more digestible steps. And naturally this approach is something I apply to my experience at BLOC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how has my experience at BLOC been? Overall, really good. Now, mind you, at the time of this post, I am only 12% into the program, so things can still sway one way or the other. But, let’s break it down a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am on the Software Developer track at a pace of 54 weeks (just over a year). If you wish to learn more about their other courses click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloc.io&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software developer track (SDT) at BLOC, at a pace of 54 weeks, suggests that at least 20 hours of work a week are required. I have found that is the bare minimum. I have had weeks where I spent over 40 hours working through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have made progress through the program I have had to readjust my strategy to be a successful student. I have spoken to my family about my time commitment and how it is going to take time away from other activities and made sure they are ok with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I quantified my available hours in a day and simply compared it to the amount of hours required by the SDT. Not the best approach. You see, I typically get home from work at 5:30 PM, so I simply thought, &lt;em&gt;‘well, I will work on BLOC from 6 PM to 10 PM on weekdays (4 hours per day) and 5 hours on saturday and 5 hours on sunday, for a total of 30 hours a week, that should do it.’&lt;/em&gt;  Well, in reality, after waking up at 4:45 and commuting for 45 mins and putting in an average of 10 hours of engineering work a day at my job, the quality of work that I am able to put into the program is not the best; I feel tired, hungry and the whole experience becomes a little more frustrating. Furthermore, any sort of hurdle that keeps me up past 11 PM (which are not uncommon) directly affects my sleep. While this may not seem like much, when you are facing 54 weeks of it, the strategy needs to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do I do now? I get home, say hi to the family, have a quick bite, set my alarm and take an hour long nap. No checking Facebook, turning on the TV or any other distraction. I typically work on the program from 8 PM to 11:30 PM now. I have found that if I take a nap, even if I am only able to put in 2 hours of work a day, the quality of my work  is a lot better and I am able to troubleshoot a little better faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most useful thing I have learned from the people at bloc is that you don’t need to know everything, in fact, don’t even try, because you never will, the information is too vast. Rather, the goal should be to &lt;em&gt;“know enough that you can keep moving forward.”&lt;/em&gt; Know where things are for future reference but don’t waste time studying and researching details that are not beneficial to the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Jeykll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

Here's an example of an image, which is included using Markdown:

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Pygments by default.


&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// count to ten&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Widget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;respond_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# show.html.erb&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;json: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@widget&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// count to twenty&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$ --&gt;

        <title>Biggest challenge when learning to develop</title>
        <link>http://localhost:4000/2017/08/19/challenge.html</link>
        <guid isPermaLink="true">http://localhost:4000/2017/08/19/challenge.html</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge I have faced when learning to develop is time management. I am an incredibly curious person and even though that almost always leads to a good outcome, it is not particularly productive when you are trying to build something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to set some rules for myself in order to keep focused. I will work on a task for an hour, if after an hour I haven’t made any progress, I have to remind myself to ask for help. Reach out to my mentor, my slack channel or simply call a friend for a fresh set of eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, it is easy to get distracted and suddenly lose 3 hours staring at my phone. I have mitigated this with some basic conditioning. I put on my headphones and loop some rain sounds. The rule is, while there is rain playing I am focused and totally immersed in my code. There are no distractions and nothing else requires my attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while of doing this, the mind is able to slip into that focused state simply by listening to a trigger, in this case, rain. This may be written off as overly simplistic but it is really powerful. Build a habit and attach it to some cue to make it a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
